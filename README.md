This  Application took me more time than the Application which i made Earlier

It was very simple functionality but more dynamic in nature than other above two Application.

You just have to enter your Intagram user id and Password and then enter the hashtags of your choice (e.g - food, bmw, travelblog, supercars etc) 

there is default Comments with emoji already i written in the instragram-main.py file 
but if you want to enter your own comments than enter into the comments text entry box otherwise default Comment will be used.
